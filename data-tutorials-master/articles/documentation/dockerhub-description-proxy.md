## Hortonworks Sandbox Proxy on Docker

The Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF) provides a "data-in-motion‚Äù solution.

The Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) provides a "data-at-rest" solution.

When you want best of both worlds, you want "Connected Data Architecture".

The Hortonworks Sandbox Proxy is a small Docker container, which facilitates communication between the two sandboxes (HDF and HDP).
