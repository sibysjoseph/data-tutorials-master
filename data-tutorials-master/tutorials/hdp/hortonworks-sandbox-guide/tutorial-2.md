-   Ambari Server (run as root user)
-   Ambari Agent (non-java)

-   Kafka
-   Log Search

## Services In Maintenance Mode

Due to limited resources available in the sandbox's virtual environment, the following services are in maintenance mode and will not automatically start.

To fully use these services, you must allocate more memory to the sandbox's virtual machine or turn off existing services.  If you want these services to automatically start, turn off maintenance mode from within the Ambari dashboard.

-   NiFi Registry
