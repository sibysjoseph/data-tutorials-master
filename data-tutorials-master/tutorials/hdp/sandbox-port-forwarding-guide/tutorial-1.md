# Sandbox Port Forwarding on VirtualBox

## Introduction

In order to explain opening ports and port forwarding in the VirtualBox version of the Hortonworks Sandbox, it may be a good idea to first have a high level view of what the sandbox looks like. Have a look at the graphic below, which shows where the sandbox exists in relation to the outside world and the port forwarding that exists.

## Prerequisites

-   [Have Hortonworks Sandbox installed]()

## Outline

-   [SSH Into the VM Running Docker](#ssh-into-the-vm-running-docker)
-   [Add Ports to the Docker Script](#add-ports-to-the-docker-script)
-   [Remove the Current Sandbox Container](#remove-the-current-sandbox-container)
-   [Restart the VM Running Docker](#restart-the-vm-running-docker)
-   [Forward VirtualBox Ports](#forward-virtualbox-ports)
-   [Summary](#summary)

## SSH Into the VM Running Docker

We need to login to the virtual machine that runs the sandbox container. If you use the standard sandbox `ssh -p 2222 root@sandbox.hortonworks.com`, you will actually log into the sandbox container, not the containing VM where Docker changes are made. You want to log into the VM running Docker with the following command:

```
ssh -p 2122 root@sandbox.hortonworks.com
```

> Note: The default password is `hadoop`.

## Add Ports to the Docker Script

The script in the VM that is responsible for creating the dockerized sandbox container is located at `/root/start_scripts/start_sandbox.sh`.

Open `/root/start_scripts/start_sandbox.sh` to reveal the docker script, which looks something like the following:

```
docker run -v hadoop:/hadoop --name sandbox --hostname "sandbox.hortonworks.com" --privileged -d \
-p 6080:6080 \
-p 9090:9090 \
-p 9000:9000 \
-p 8000:8000 \
-p 8020:8020 \
-p 2181:2181 \
-p 42111:42111 \
...
```

Edit this file and add your desired port forward.  In this example, we're going to forward host port 15000 to sandbox port 15000.  The file should now look something like the following:

```
docker run -v hadoop:/hadoop --name sandbox --hostname "sandbox.hortonworks.com" --privileged -d \
-p 15000:15000 \
-p 6080:6080 \
-p 9090:9090 \
-p 9000:9000 \
-p 8000:8000 \
-p 8020:8020 \
-p 2181:2181 \
-p 42111:42111 \
...
```

## Remove the Current Sandbox Container

Terminate the existing sandbox container, and then remove it.

> Warning: Be aware that this deletes the sandbox, changes are not saved.  If you want to save the work you've done inside the sandbox, first run: `docker commit sandbox sandbox`.

```
docker stop sandbox
docker rm sandbox
```

## Restart the VM Running Docker

We now restart the VM running Docker.  Upon restart, the script we modified above will be run in order to start the sandbox container.  Since we removed the container in the previous step, the sandbox container is first rebuilt with your newly specified port forwards.

One easy method of restarting the VM is executing the following command:
```
init 6
```

## Forward VirtualBox Ports

We now need to update the ports forwarded by VirtualBox.  Open VirtualBox, right-click on the sandbox entry and select "**Settings**".

![VirtualBox Entry Settings](assets/vbox-entry-settings.jpg)

In the "**Network**" tab, expand the adapter's "**Advanced**" section, and click "**Port Forwarding**".

![VirtualBox Network Tab](assets/vbox-network-tab.jpg)

Click the `Settings` button and go to the `Network` tab, click `Advanced` and `Port Forwarding`:

Click on the `+` icon on the right of the window to create a new port forwarding rule.  Enter any "**Name**" for your port forward, set the "**Host IP**" to "**127.0.0.1**", and enter your desired new port forward.

![VirtualBox Add Port Forward](assets/vbox-add-port-forward.jpg)

Click "**OK**" until your out of the settings.  You're all done!  Changes take effect immediately - no need to reset VirtualBox.

## Summary

You've successfully modified the sandbox container's startup script and VirtualBox settings in order to add in new port forwards.  The forwarded ports allow you to access processes running on the sandbox from your host system (i.e. your computer and browser).
