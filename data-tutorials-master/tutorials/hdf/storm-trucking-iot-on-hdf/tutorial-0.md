# Storm in Trucking IoT on HDF

## Introduction

This tutorial will cover the core concepts of Storm and the role it plays in an environment where real-time, low-latency and distributed data processing is important.

We will build a Storm topology from the ground up and demonstrate a full data pipeline, from Internet of Things (IoT) data ingestion from the edge, to data processing with Storm, to persisting this data and viewing it in a visualization web application.


## Prerequisites

-   [Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF) Sandbox Installed](https://hortonworks.com/downloads/#sandbox)


## Outline

- [Trucking IoT Use Case](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/storm-in-trucking-iot-on-hdf/section/1/) - Discuss a real-world use case and understand the role Storm plays within in.
- [Running the Demo](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/storm-in-trucking-iot-on-hdf/section/2/) - Walk through the demo and first gain an understanding of the data pipeline.
- [Building a Storm Topology](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/storm-in-trucking-iot-on-hdf/section/3/) - Dive into Storm internals and build a topology from scratch.
- [Deploying the Topology](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/storm-in-trucking-iot-on-hdf/section/4/) - Package the Storm code and deploy onto your cluster.
